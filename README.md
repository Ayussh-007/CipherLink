# CipherLink
CipherLink is a command-line based chat application built entirely in Python, designed for secure, encrypted communication between users over a local or simulated network. It uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) with public-private key cryptography, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message â€” not even the server can see the contents.
